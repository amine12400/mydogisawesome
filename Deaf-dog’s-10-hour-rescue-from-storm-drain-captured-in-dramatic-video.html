        <h1>Deaf dog’s 10-hour rescue from storm drain captured in dramatic video </h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every dog has their day —&nbsp;and Zoey brought out an entire city to make sure hers really made a viral video impression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The deaf, 15-year-old mutt is safely back in the arms of her doting family after her harrowing, 10-hour rescue from a mud-clogged storm drain pipe in Texas on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dozens of workers arrived at the scene to help smash up the street in order to reach a cowering Zoey, who found herself lost in a storm drain, under several feet of concrete and dirt. In the end, it took the combined citywide efforts of the Arlington Fire Department, police, paramedics and other workers toiling into the night to save the trapped pet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The AFD&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/440126536033645/videos/4542392292467191" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared detailed footage</a>&nbsp;of the massive rescue effort via Facebook on Monday, which has racked up more than 17,000 views as of Tuesday morning, with many in the comments relieved to see Zoey pull through.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“People were hearing animal sounds — but they were hearing them all over the neighborhood,” Andrea Tankersley, the dog’s owner, told local news station&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/watch-arlington-texas-firefighters-rescue-a-15-year-old-deaf-dog-from-a-storm-drain/287-ada666bb-011f-40db-8483-50655ae9a0bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WFAA</a>.</p>

<p>“The difficult part is she’s deaf,” her husband, Brennan Tankersley, added. “So we’re calling out to her, calling out to her, of course knowing it’s not any good but you can’t help it.”</p>

<p>The whole neighborhood was reportedly eager to help, including Hunter, a kindergartner who offered his own skateboard after a firefighter suggested it could be useful in pulling the dog out — which it was, according to WFAA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He was just so enthusiastic about helping us. It was just so heartwarming,” said officer Kristi Weil, who plans to return the skateboard this week after rescue teams sign the board as a memento for Hunter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, others in the community offered water, pizzas and anything else crews may need for the daylong ordeal.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They had to come up with plan B and plan C and plan D,” Andrea said. “They were just going to do whatever it took.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The local water department had snaked a camera through the pipe to keep eyes on Zoey during the citywide operation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s hard to watch,” Brennan said. “She’s just sitting there panting. You know she’s hot. You know she’s tired.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remarkably, the old girl was returned to the Tankersleys relatively unscathed.</p>

<p>“[It’s a] miracle, definitely. Miraculous,” Andrea said. “I don’t know how she came out not more broken or more injured.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Everyone has been so helpful,” officer Weil added. “There have been cheers of joy, and tears, when Zoey was rescued. And I love seeing the community turn out and cheer a successful end to this.”</p>
