<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lloyd, the four-year-old whippet, is dressed by his owner Paz Castro, from Hackney, London in stylish minimalistic outifts that match her own</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An adorable whippet has become an Instagram sensation thanks to his incredible clothes that match his mum's outfits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lloyd's owner Paz Castro, from Hackney, London, has bought a number of matching outfits for Lloyd that go with nearly every one of Paz's clothes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most pet-store bought dog clothes are brightly coloured, which Paz disliked because they did not match her minimalistic dressing style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The jewellery designer bought all of Lloyd's outfits to match hers, with signature colours that include creams, whites, navy, black and grey. The adorable pup even shares a wardrobe with Paz and her husband, who says that the two take up most of the wardrobe space with their numerous stylish jackets.</p>

<p>Paz said: “I don’t have kids yet but Lloyd is my baby and I just wanted him to be a reflection of what I want. Recently he hasn’t been wearing anything but raincoats. In England you have to be prepared for whatever comes. But he’s very lucky to get sent lots of clothes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lloyd has a collection of raincoats which turns people’s heads in the street. But like everyone else, Paz has her more favoured outfit pieces to strut about East London in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My favourite thing to wear is a big jacket – it will cover me from all the dog paws. It’s good to be able to not be bothered because you expect dogs to jump up you, it will happen. You can’t be too precious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I love Lloyd in a onesie – he has a couple of those in different colours.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/allaboutlloyd_/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">their Instagram</a>, they have gathered almost 25,000 followers for showcasing their twin outfits in beautifully taken pictures. Paz says she takes the images herself and usually uses self-timer to capture them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Originally from Chile, Paz created the account so friends and family in South America could see him in his outfits. “My mum knows that she can go to Instagram and see Lloyd. She is my biggest fan. If I haven’t posted she will remind me I haven’t posted many outfits with Lloyd.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paz spent years working in the fashion industry, which is reflected in her and Lloyd’s style. Lloyd has even modelled for designer brands including Burberry and Axel Arigato after being noticed for his elegance and style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But over recent years, Paz says she is trying to become more sustainable with the clothing she and Lloyd wear. She also admits that they don’t always match outfits because comfort is key in life.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said: “I’m not a crazy spender. I still buy from the brands that I like for him. But the last few years I’ve decided to reduce the amount of shopping I do, and to shop better and more local. And practicality is important because obviously he’s a dog, he goes for walks and it gets messy, but I like to add in a bit of style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We don’t match every day but I do try and at least match the tone. I wouldn’t put him in red and me wear something green. Most of the time at home Lloyd is naked. I won’t dress him for the sake of it.</p>
