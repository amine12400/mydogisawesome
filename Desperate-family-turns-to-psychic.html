        <h1>Desperate family turns to psychic to try to find missing deaf dog with dementia</h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Owners Patricia and Thomas Pothecary are desperate to find their cocker spaniel Tamba, 14, using heat-seeking drones and now turning to a psychic to try to locate the pooch</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A psychic has been deployed to help find a beloved&nbsp;dog&nbsp;in the latest move by the family to bring their pooch home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Owners Patricia and Thomas Pothecary, both 69, from Westbury-on-Severn are "devastated" by the loss of cocker spaniel Tamba, 14, who is deaf and has dementia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The family have already dispatched five heat-seeking drones it their bid to find Tamba but have now turned to the supernatural powers of a local psychic,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/psychic-joins-drones-search-find-5730536" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gloucestershire Live reports.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tamba went missing in Linton Farm, Highnam, on Saturday (July 31) at about 10am and dozens of volunteers have been out searching for the spaniel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24670549.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_tamba-missing-dog-who-is-deaf.jpg" alt="Tamba's owners have deployed heat-seeking drones to find her"/><figcaption><strong>Tamba's owners have deployed heat-seeking drones to find her</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The psychic is using "triangulation" to try and pin-point where Tamba may be and suggested that cows and buildings could be significant in the hunt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The owner's niece, Shannon Stroud, has been helping with the search and is hopeful that the psychic can be of help and if unsuccessful the family have been offered the services of a person who owns an ex-sniffer dog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 23-year-old said: "We don’t really know much about her, to be honest. She was talking about triangulation and the potential that it is related to cows and buildings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She hasn’t asked us for any money or anything like that. She came out and searched the area and she’s given us ideas of where to look. She seemed very sincere.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shannon said if this works out “if this psychic comes through and is correct, we’ll be putting her name on a banner”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately not all the attention has been welcomed, with one person pretending to have Tamba and only willing to release her for a ransom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shannon said: “It’s shows the extent of how low people go really. Obviously there is a devastated family. Fourteen years they’ve had this dog, longer than some people have had their children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So for all intents and purposes, loving animals the way we do – they are our children. So for somebody to call up, antagonise and upset an already distraught family just shows the extent of how low some people are willing to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The minority ruin it for the majority, we’ve had so much genuine help and support – people from the community and the farm. We’ve only had one piece of negative communication and it’s upset the entire atmosphere.”</p>
