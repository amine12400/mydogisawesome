        <h1>Disabled dog rescued from China travels 5,000 miles to find forever home in UK</h1>
A disabled&nbsp;Pomeranian that was rescued from being sold into the Chinese meat trade has travelled around the world to find a forever home in London.

Pandi, short for Pandita, found a loving family 4,800 miles away from&nbsp;China&nbsp;after living the early stages of her life in a cage being used to breed after being born with no use in her back legs.

But when she couldn't breed anymore the three-and-a-half-year-old dog was 'sold-off-for-meat,'&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/disabled-dog-rescued-china-finds-21068822" target="_self" rel="Follow noopener" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link">MyLondon reports.</a>

Thankfully this fluffy white cutie was assisted by a number of rescues and agents based in Asia, before being brought to the&nbsp;UK&nbsp;by the&nbsp;Silver Fox Dog Rescue, where she was spotted by Alessandra.

The previous owner of a special needs Chihuahua named Noodles – who sadly passed away a few months ago, aged 14 – Alessandra was on the lookout for an&nbsp;animal&nbsp;in need to provide a loving home.

She said: “I’m adamant about rehoming a dog, not buying one. Almost all of my dogs have been rehomed – Noodles was.

“But thanks to lockdown, there are so few dogs left in the shelters, and a million applicants per dog, that I was always counted out for being single, or not having a garden… despite the fact that I was looking to rehome a Chihuahua.

<aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""></aside>When she saw Pandi, listed as ‘Trixie’ on the site, she immediately felt she had found the one.

“She was my dog, and I knew it. Even if she wasn’t a Chihuahua, and cost a lot more than I had in the bank.

<aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""></aside>Knowing that the adoption feeds, transport from Lancashire and other necessities would cost at least £1,000, Alessandra set up a&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.gofundme.com/f/penniesforpandi" rel="nofollow">GoFundMe</a>&nbsp;in the hopes of getting some financial support from other&nbsp;dog lovers. It was titled, adorably, ‘Pennies for Pandi’.

Although Pandi had had an operation to fuse her legs straight before she left China – meaning she now has partial mobility in her back legs – the sweet pup can’t walk for more than 10 minutes and requires a pram, as well as a set of wheels.

Alessandra used her baking business to help direct funds towards ‘Pennies for Pandi’, including running a bake sale.

The campaign met – and in fact, exceeded – its goal, with 21 donors and £1,140 raised in total so far.

Any funds raised over the target will be directed towards the same rescue charity, which is waiting to bring more dogs to the UK but faces costly adoption and agency fees – an estimated £3000 per pup.
