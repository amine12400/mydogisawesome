        <h1>This Husky Raised By Cats Thinks It Is Actually A Cat</h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are some of us who probably believe that we were born inside of the wrong bodies. We are willing to bet that a sizable number of readers wish that they could be a cat or a dog instead. After all, wouldn’t it be nice to lay around the house all day while the master handles all of the stresses of workaday life? The Husky in this story just might fall into that category.</p>

<p>She’s finally found her spirit animal. It may be a bit different from what you would typically expect, though. Tally is a very unique animal. She was raised in a household full of cats. Now, she seems to think that she is one herself. The Husky is partially mixed with malamute but it is easier to refer to her in this way. The malamute and the Husky share a number of physical traits, anyway.</p>

<p>The malamute tends to be much less aggressive. Huskies are far more boisterous. Tally has leaned into her malamute side completely. Now that she has spent so much time around cats, she has elected to act like one. The mental image is already cracking us up. If her humans do something that she does not like, she will urinate on the floor to express her displeasure.</p>

<p>Much like a cat, she also loves to pick the worst possible areas to relieve herself. When she sits down on the floor, she even sits like cats do. She’ll tuck her arms and legs beneath her body. This is not her first home. From the looks of it, she became more of a cat because of her previous owners. Since she did not have any dogs to hang out with, it is easy to see why she became a cat by nature.</p>

<p>The pictures of her hanging out at home are making us yell with laughter. She’s the sort of dog who loves getting into all kinds of mischief. However, there is something very feline about the way that she goes about it. This confused dog is too cute to ever be mad at. Her family loves everything about her and they would not ever change her for the world.</p>
