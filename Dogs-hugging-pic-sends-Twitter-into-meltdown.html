<p>However Dog Whisperer Cesar Millan reckons a dog hugging is not really a sign of affection, more one of dominance, as he explains on his website&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cesarsway.com/have-you-bugged-your-dog-today/">cesarsway.com</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&amp;utm_source=reach-dailystar&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=thumbnails-mid:Mid%20Article%20Thumbnails%20Daily%20Star:" target="_blank"></a></p>

<p>He said: "See it from the dog’s point of view. While they can grab things between their front legs, they generally only do it when they are play-fighting, actually fighting, or humping something — and those actions are all about dominance, not affection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"To animals in general, being suddenly grabbed around the body is usually a sign that a predator has gotten hold of them, in which case it’s time to fight to the death in order to escape."</p>
