        <h1>Joyful German shepherd plays with unlikely new pal , a young black bear , touching video</h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A wild black bear and a domestic dog struck up a bear-y pawsome friendship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jenn Sargent, who owns a German shepherd, discovered that her pup made an unexpected friend during a shocking backyard playdate caught on her security camera.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Vermont resident, 37, was attending to her household chores when her neighbors notified her that her dog Jameson was playing with a bear in the grass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Left to his own devices, Jameson was seen in the video footage attempting to get his new backyard bud to join in a game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, Jameson did succeed and the two new friends chased each other around the yard and the wild bear rose up to its hind legs eager to play along.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sargent, a mom of two, said she was amused by the footage but was also relieved her pooch didn’t bark up the wrong tree with the 150-pound bear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“While it was a great video, my main emotion was pure relief,” she told Kennedy News. “I was thankful my young children were not outside, the dog had no injuries and the fact that this bear was in a playful mood.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sargent said the new playmates cavorted around “for about seven minutes in total” and that she was thankful that “neither Jameson nor the bear” was injured.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also noted that “this could have been a bad ending” — especially since it’s not the first time this bear and a larger one, thought to be its mother, were spotted around the town. But Sargent said her dog “did appear to be looking for him to come back and play.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jameson is usually quite territorial and not this playful with strangers,” she said, noting that “bears live in the area but they are not usually this brave.”</p>
