        <h1>Adorable Police Puppy Sleeps Through His Entire Swearing-In Ceremony</h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brody is a working dog who’s just starting his very important career as a K-9 police officer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sweet little pup has joined the police force in Bristol, Rhode Island, and was recently given a swearing-in ceremony to mark his new position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ceremony was broadcasted on the Bristol, R.I. Police Department&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BristolPD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>&nbsp;page and has brightened the day of every viewer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While little Brody is excited to be a K-9, he was less interested in the actual ceremony; in the video, the adorable pup is seen sleeping through the ceremony while his new partner, Officer Medeiros, serve as the sleepy pups stand-in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brody is part of a new initiative and he will be visiting schools and nursing homes and spending time connecting with the local community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’ll also be working alongside other officers and help comfort victims of crime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With such an important and exciting job it’s no wonder that this little guy needs all the sleep he can get.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div id="attachment_68407" class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://myawesomedoggy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/adorable-police-puppy-sleeps-through-his-entire-swearing-in-ceremony-02.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-68407"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bpdk9brody/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bpdk9brody</a></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brody managed to nap through the entirety of the ceremony and only woke up when it was time to pose for the camera with his new certificate and his partner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The little pup still looked half-asleep but at least his partner had enough energy for two.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the video, Police Chief Kevin Lynch speaks passionately about the furry little police pup and states that “He’s going to be a superstar for the town of Bristol. You can guarantee it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not even these words of praise were enough to catch Brody’s attention, but we’re sure he’s used to being told what a good boy he is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":68408,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->
<div id="attachment_68408" class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://myawesomedoggy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/adorable-police-puppy-sleeps-through-his-entire-swearing-in-ceremony-03.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-68408"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bpdk9brody/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bpdk9brody</a></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Brody is even half as good at caring for people as he is at napping, he’ll definitely be a superstar in no-time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The little guy seems to take any chance he can get to melt into a little sleepy, chocolate brown puddle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":68409,"linkDestination":"custom"} -->
<div id="attachment_68409" class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://myawesomedoggy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/adorable-police-puppy-sleeps-through-his-entire-swearing-in-ceremony-04.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-68409"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bpdk9brody/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bpdk9brody</a></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Police Chief Lynch is sure that Brody will be a fantastic asset to the force.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brody will not only comfort witnesses and victims of crime and ease their anxiety during police investigations, but he’ll hopefully become a bridge between the police and the local community and build a sense of trust and connectedness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div id="attachment_68412" class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://myawesomedoggy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/adorable-police-puppy-sleeps-through-his-entire-swearing-in-ceremony-05.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-68412"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bpdk9brody/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bpdk9brody</a></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re very excited for Brody to meet the people in our community and we’re very excited for him to meet the students in the Bristol-Warren Regional School District,” Medeiros said during the video.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The young pup has a great responsibility, but it’s clear that he’s up to the task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With his gentle spirit and adorable appearance he exudes love and comfort, and even over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/bpdk9brody/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, his beautiful eyes have a distinctly calming effect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Little Brody may have slept through his ceremony, but he’s just saving his energy for all the important work he has ahead of him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s such a good little boy and the people of Bristol, Rhode Island are lucky to have such an adorable and dedicated pup as a member of the local police.</p>
