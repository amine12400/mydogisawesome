        <h1>Woman Gets Letter From A Stranger Then Notices It Is Actually For her Dog</h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maria Luiza Valcazara recently moved into a new apartment by herself in Brazil. She thought it would be a good idea to have a dog, so she adopted Chips, her new pup. It wasn’t long before they bonded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes, Chips gets sad when she would leave him at home. It turns out that someone noticed his sadness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://myawesomedoggy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-23.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44748"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many dogs suffer from separation anxiety and get lonely when they are home alone. Chips would whine and bark until she came home again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since Valcazara was still new in the area, she didn’t know her neighbors. She was hoping that Chips wasn’t disturbing anyone while she was gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One day she came home and there was a package with a letter outside her door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":44749} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://myawesomedoggy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-21.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44749"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“At the time, I was scared,” Valcazara told The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedodo.com/close-to-home/stranger-writes-note-to-neighbors-dog-brazil">Dodo</a>. “I wondered who could have left it there at the door, since I had little contact with the people in the building.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Valcazara got nervous when she found out that the letter was addressed to her dog. It had actually been ‘written’ by Corote, another dog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When she opened the package, she found some dog toys inside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is what the letter said, after it was translated from Portuguese.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hi, my friend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve noticed that you’ve been crying a lot when you’re alone, and I’ve been through this phase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I talked to my mom yesterday and together we decided to give you these toys, so you have a distraction when you feel alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m here to make you an invitation: I live alone with Mom and, because of that, I have a room of my own to horse around in as much as I want, so you can spend some time here with me! We can do a lot of partying together!!!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope you enjoy the things we gave you!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many kisses from Corote and of my mother Nichole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chips couldn’t have been happier with the gifts and Valcazara was moved by what happened</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When I started to read the letter, I cried a lot,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Valcaara had not yet met Nichole or Corote but they knew of her. Considering the invitation, a proper introduction was in order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":44752} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://myawesomedoggy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44752"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I took Chips to [Nichole’s] apartment so we could talk and our two dogs could meet,” Valcazara said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The dogs and their owners became friends quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Nichole offered to help me with Chips whenever I needed it,” Valcazara said. “She gave me some tips she learned from raising Corote.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Things have gotten much better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":44753} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://myawesomedoggy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44753"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tips that Nichole offered helped to ease Chips’ anxiety with his mother was away. The friendship that they forged made it possible for a lot of fun. Almost every day, they meet up for a playdate on the lawn out in front of the building where they live.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Funny how this all started with a simple letter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I concluded that there are still good people in our world,” Valcazara said. “It was a beautiful gesture Nichole made for us. And I’m sure other people can benefit through their animals, too. I am an example of this. Besides having a neighbor, I now have a wonderful friend!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m sure Chips and Corote would agree.</p>
